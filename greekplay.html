        <h2>"King Oedipus" by Sophocles</h2>
        <p>OED. Words have no terror for the soul that dares
            Such doings.
            
            CH.          Yet lives one who shall convict him.
            For look where now they lead the holy seer,
            Whom sacred Truth inspires alone of men.
            
            _Enter_ TIRESIAS.
            
            OED. O thou whose universal thought commands
            All knowledge and all mysteries, in Heaven
            And on the earth beneath, thy mind perceives,
            Tirésias, though thine outward eye be dark,
            What plague is wasting Thebè, who in thee,
            Great Sir, finds her one saviour, her sole guide.
            Phoebus (albeit the messengers perchance
            Have told thee this) upon our sending sent
            This answer back, that no release might come
            From this disaster, till we sought and found
            And slew the murderers of king Laius,
            Or drave them exiles from our land. Thou, then,
            Withhold not any word of augury
            Or other divination which thou knowest,
            But rescue Thebè, and thyself, and me,
            And purge the stain that issues from the dead.
            On thee we lean: and 'tis a noble thing
            To use what power one hath in doing good.
            
            TIRESIAS. Ah! terrible is knowledge to the man
            Whom knowledge profits not. This well I knew,
            But had forgotten. Else I ne'er had come.
            
            OED. Why dost thou bring a mind so full of gloom?
            
            TI. Let me go home. Thy part and mine to-day
            Will best be borne, if thou obey me in that.
            
            OED. Disloyal and ungrateful! to deprive
            The state that reared thee of thine utterance now.</p>
